            <h2> What is a PS4 and a Xbox?:</h2>
                <h3> A PS4 and an Xbox are two different consoles ran by two different companies. They both have their own unique 
                    style, for example, their logo. Not just their logo is different however, it is also the games that they 
                    support, the <u>Exclusive</u> games that each console supports, and much more. There are, of cource, many other ways we can look at both consoles, for example, their next generation
                    consoles, the add ons to there present consoles, the controllers that it supports, and much more. Sadly, we will
                    only be able to go over the companies behind the program, the hardware in the program, which console is more 
                    popular, which games the consoles support and if those games are popular or not, and at the end, we will add all of that up together
                    and make a concolusion on which one is better.

                    <h2>Which console is more popular</h2>
                    <h3>Well, there are many reviews for the PS4 and the Xbox. But before I continue, I just want to say that you can like
                        what ever console you would like. It doesn't matter what reviews are good or bad, you can always try one or the other and see 
                        if you like it or not. But, the reviews are a good way to tell if the console (or any product) is good or not. But the actual
                        reviews for the PS4 and the Xbox are far apart. The PS4 has 42,342 reviws with 4.8 stars which is very good. The Xbox has 16,493
                        reviews with 4.7 stars. These are both, good reviews and they are used by many users. The review comments seem pretty
                        good. But out of all the reviwes from comments to stars to reviews in general. The PS4 beats the the Xbox in reviews by a lot.

                    <h2>What is the difference hardware wise?</h2>
                    <h3>
                        Well, according to this image down below, the PS4 has a better system than the Xbox. They both use an AMD 8-core 
                        "Jaguar" in both PS4 and in the Xbox. However, the PS4 has a better AMD Radeon based GPU with about 18 compute
                        units and 1152 shader cores. The PS4 also wins in peak power with 1.84 TFLOPS, the PS4 had better RAM memory,
                        and lastly they both have 500GB HDD, but on the PS4, it is removable and replacable, but on the Xbox it isn't. So
                        to conclude, when it comes to hardware, the PS4 is better.

                    <h2>Which console has better games?</h2>
                    <h3>
                        Both consoles have some of the same games, and sometimes, they both have games that is only available on either console.
                        Their is also something called cross-platform and it is when a game is available on multiple devices,
                        such as a mobile device, a computer, a nintendo switch, the console/device you are playing on, and sometimes more devices depending on the game (but we are only going to be talking about the Xbox and the PS4.) 
                        For example, Fortnite has the cross-platform feature where and you can play with multiple platforms. But the question was never answered, which console has the better games. Well, today,
                        we are going to compare the two best games on both consoles. For the PS4, the best two games are "The Last of Us part II" and "God of war."
                        "God of War" has been released since April 2018 and has 1677 ratings and has 4.8 stars. However, "The Last of Us Part II" doesn't 
                        have as good ratings as "God of war." "The Last of us part II" has 52,022 ratings and has 2.7 stars. Both of 
                        these games are only available on the PS4. The most popular two Xbox games are "Horizion Zero Dawn"  and "Red Dead Redemption 2." "Horizion Zero Dawn"
                        was released in Feburary 17th and has 4,890 reviews with 4.8 stars. "Red Dead Redemption 2" was released on October 18th and has 17,048 
                        reviews with 4.8 stars. Unlike the PS4, both of those Xbox games are available on the PS4. It seems like the last two games I just talked about are the best reviwed, but the PS4 can use those games as well. So, to conclude, it seems 
                        likes the PS4 beat the Xbox in game popularity.
